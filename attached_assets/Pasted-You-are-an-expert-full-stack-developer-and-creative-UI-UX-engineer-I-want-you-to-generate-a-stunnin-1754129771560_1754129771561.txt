You are an expert full-stack developer and creative UI/UX engineer. I want you to generate a stunning, fully responsive developer portfolio web app using React and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio must follow modern design principles with smooth animation, glassmorphism, 3D components, and gradient aesthetics.

# üîß Tech Stack & Libraries:
- React.js (latest version)
- Tailwind CSS (with plugins: @tailwindcss/typography, @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/animations)
- Framer Motion (for animation)
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger (for scroll-based animation)
- Lenis (smooth scrolling)
- Vanta.js or Spline (for background 3D visuals)
- react-icons (for all icons)
- emailjs-com (for contact form)
- swiper.js or keen-slider (for testimonial carousel)
- react-tilt or custom CSS for 3D hover effect

# üß± Sections & Layout Requirements:

1. Hero / Landing:
- Full-screen glassmorphic container
- "Hi, I‚Äôm Tahir ‚Äî a Creative Full Stack Developer"
- Tagline: "Turning ideas into functional digital products with pixel-perfect code."
- 2 CTA buttons: "Hire Me", "See My Work"
- 3D Spline or animated background
- Cursor bubble animation following user cursor
- Motion and parallax effects on text & buttons

2. About Me:
- Short, human-readable paragraph about me
- Developer timeline with subtle animation
- Glass or gradient background
- Fade-in effects on scroll

3. Skills:
- Categorized skill cards (Frontend, Backend, Tools)
- Each card must have icon, skill name, experience level
- Animate-in with framer-motion or AOS
- Neon gradient card hover effects
- Optional: radial skill charts (optional)

4. Projects:
- 3 to 4 Projects displayed in 3D tilt cards
- Show image preview, stack used, project description
- Flip or modal to show GitHub/Live Demo buttons
- Gradient glowing borders and scroll animation
- Responsive grid layout

5. Services:
- 3-4 animated cards with icon, title, short description
- Flip or reveal effect on hover
- Glassmorphic cards with motion scale on hover

6. Testimonials (Mock Data):
- 2‚Äì3 testimonial cards using swiper or slider
- Avatar, name, quote
- Fade-in / slide-in animation

7. Contact Me:
- Simple form with Name, Email, Message
- Connect to EmailJS
- Show animated success response
- Use Lottie or checkmark animation if needed

8. Footer:
- Social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, WhatsApp)
- Quick navigation links
- Subtle fade-in on scroll

# üé® Design Guidelines:
- Glassmorphism with soft blur and translucent cards
- Full-site animation using framer-motion + scroll libraries
- Cursor aura/bubble animation when hovering
- Smooth scrolling (Lenis)
- Neon & gradient themes (CoolHue palette or custom)
- Use Haikei for SVG backgrounds where applicable
- Fully mobile-responsive with Tailwind grid/flex layout
- Avoid unnecessary libraries unless specified

# üíº Bonus Behavior:
- Include dark mode support (optional switch toggle)
- Lazy-load sections on scroll
- Use IntersectionObserver for performance
- Load data from /data folders or mock arrays for now

# üìÅ Folder Structure:
Structure the codebase cleanly:
- /components ‚Üí all sections
- /assets ‚Üí images/icons
- /data ‚Üí static data for skills/projects
- /App.jsx ‚Üí main layout
- Use functional components and clean Tailwind utility classes

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
Don't build the admin panel now, but structure the project such that I can later add Firebase/Supabase-based CMS for dynamic content editing.

# üì¶ Final Output:
Return a complete scaffolded React project folder structure with:
- All components
- Tailwind setup
- Working animations
- Mobile responsiveness
- Beautiful, clean code
- Ready to deploy on Vercel or Netlify
