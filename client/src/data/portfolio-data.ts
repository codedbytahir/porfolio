    story: "Hi I'm student software engineer who like to break things just to figure out how to solve this problem usually with java/spring boot. I build backend systems that try their best to work on the first try (no promises though). Java spring boot vscode and console.log are my daily tools, and I'm currently discovering the mysterious lands of frontend development. When I'm not coding, I'm either daydreaming startup ideas, lurking on GitHub, or explaining to my friends why 'it works on my machine' is totally valid. I love creating stuff that's fun, functional, and maybe a little chaotic.",
